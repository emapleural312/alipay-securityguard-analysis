## Independent Verification (Docker)

You don't have to trust us. Verify everything yourself in ~15 minutes:

```bash
# Option A: Docker (recommended — handles jadx memory for 210MB APK)
docker build -t alipay-verify .
docker run -v /path/to/Alipay_10.8.30.8000.apk:/apk/Alipay.apk alipay-verify

# Option B: Manual (requires jadx with 12GB+ heap, ripgrep)
export JADX_OPTS="-Xmx12g"
./scripts/verify.sh /path/to/Alipay.apk
```

**Target APK:** Alipay v10.8.30.8000 — SHA-256: `2eebd18eb78b2bdcc737c568a8057345255b9660dbf6f5af83743644effcaad2`
Available on APKPure/APKMirror historical versions.

The verification script decompiles the APK and runs 40+ regex signature checks against the source. No patterns use absolute line numbers — all signatures are feature-based strings and class identifiers that survive obfuscation changes. See [`scripts/signatures.txt`](scripts/signatures.txt) for the full pattern list.

### Test Environment

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Static Analysis | jadx 1.5.1, apktool 2.10.0, Ghidra 11.0, radare2 5.9 |
| Dynamic Analysis | Google Pixel 6 (Android 13), Magisk 26.1, Frida 16.1.4 |
| Network Capture | mitmproxy 10.x with custom user-cert injection |
| Baseline Device | Unrooted Samsung Galaxy S23 (stock Android 14) — sideloaded APK, hardware packet capture via Wi-Fi AP |

Behaviors documented in this analysis were confirmed on **both** the rooted test device and the unrooted baseline device.

## Executive Summary

A reverse engineering analysis of the SecurityGuard SDK embedded in Alipay (v10.8.30.8000), documenting the internal architecture of the security framework in one of the world's largest mobile payment applications ([1B+ users per Ant Group IPO prospectus 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823652/)).

**Key findings:**
- Mapped all ~80 native commands through the single JNI entry point
- Captured AVMP bytecode VM signatures via custom C gadget
- Reversed 3 XOR-based string encryption variants
- Documented 22 hidden behavior monitoring events
- Identified 29-point device super-fingerprinting
- Confirmed absence of certificate pinning
- Analyzed PatchProxy remote code modification capability (90,000-146,000+ methods depending on decompilation completeness)

## Why This Is NOT Standard Anti-Fraud

We anticipate the vendor will claim these mechanisms are "routine risk control." Here is why that defense does not hold:

| Standard Risk Control | What This App Does | Why It's Different |
|---|---|---|
| Collect Device ID for fraud scoring | Collects IMEI, IMSI, MAC, Bluetooth MAC, WiFi BSSID, installed app list | Scope far exceeds fraud detection; IMEI/IMSI restricted since Android 10 |
| Hot-fix critical crashes | 146,173 methods remotely replaceable via PatchProxy, including payment password verification | Hot-patching auth logic without user consent is not crash recovery |
| Use standard Android Keystore | Custom crypto with `java.util.Random` keys, DES, AES/ECB, hardcoded constants | Bypasses hardware-backed security; uses broken algorithms |
| Detect rooted/tampered devices | Intercepts ALL AudioRecord/MediaRecorder calls; monitors clipboard, screenshots, Bluetooth | Behavioral surveillance unrelated to device integrity |
| Server-side telemetry | 2 of 8 telemetry endpoints use plaintext HTTP; WiFi RTT indoor positioning | HTTP leaks PII in transit; sub-meter indoor tracking is surveillance, not analytics |

**The principle of least privilege requires that security mechanisms collect only what is necessary.** This architecture collects everything it technically can.
