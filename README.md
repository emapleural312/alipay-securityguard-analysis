## Executive Summary

A comprehensive reverse engineering analysis of the SecurityGuard SDK embedded in Alipay (v10.8.30.8000), revealing the complete internal architecture of the security framework protecting one of the world's largest mobile payment applications (1B+ users).

**Key achievements:**

- Captured AVMP bytecode VM signatures via custom C gadget
- Reversed 3 XOR-based string encryption variants
- Documented 22 hidden behavior monitoring events
- Identified 29-point device super-fingerprinting
- Confirmed absence of certificate pinning
- Analyzed PatchProxy remote code modification capability

## Key Findings

### 1. AVMP Signature Bypass (C Gadget)

The AVMP bytecode VM — Alipay's last line of defense for request authentication — can be invoked programmatically via a 132-line C gadget operating at the JNI level:

```c
// Create VM instance
jobject vmIdObj = (*env)->CallObjectMethod(env, router, doCmd, 70201, args);
// Execute signing
jobject result = (*env)->CallObjectMethod(env, router, doCmd, 70202, outerArgs);
```

The gadget bypasses Frida's JS-JNI serialization limitation by passing `byte[].class` directly as a JNI object. Full source: [`tools/sg_avmp_gadget.c`](tools/sg_avmp_gadget.c)

### 2. No Certificate Pinning

`EmptyX509TrustManagerWrapper.checkServerTrusted()` is an empty method. The production `X509TrustManagerWrapper` only validates against system CA store. PatchProxy can remotely degrade to accept-all behavior.

### 3. Behavior Monitoring (22 Events)

SecurityGuard silently monitors: screen on/off, app foreground/background, airplane mode, time changes, screenshots, screen recording, Bluetooth connections, phone calls, headphone state, clipboard access, network changes, and all Activity lifecycle events.

### 4. DexAOP Audio API Interception (14 Points)

All `AudioRecord` and `MediaRecorder` API calls are intercepted at bytecode level via DexAOP, monitoring when any app component accesses the microphone.

### 5. permit() = null Anti-Pattern (396/408 = 97%)

A comprehensive scan of ALL 408 `BridgeExtension` classes reveals **396 (97.1%) return null from `permit()`**, meaning virtually the entire JSBridge API surface operates without access control:

```
Total BridgeExtension classes with permit(): 408
Classes where permit() returns null:         396 (97.1%)
Classes with actual permission checks:        12 (2.9%)
```

High-risk unprotected categories include:
- **Payment** (6): TradePayBridgeExtension, DCEPWalletBridgeExtension (Digital Yuan!)
- **Authentication** (5): LoginExtension, VerifyIdentityBridgeExtension
- **NFC/Contactless** (3): NFCBridgeExtension, NfcPayExtension
- **Device Hardware** (6): ScanBridgeExtension, ClipboardBridgeExtension
- **File Operations** (6): FileBridgeExtension, UploadFileBridgeExtension

See [`analysis/permit_null_full_scan.md`](analysis/permit_null_full_scan.md) for full results.

### 6. SchemeNeedVerify Opt-In Design Flaw (CVE-9)

The `SchemeNeedVerify` security gate uses an **opt-in model** — verification must be explicitly enabled per-API. The vast majority of APIs are unprotected by default. Combined with insecure plaintext HTTP transport of security configurations, this creates a systemic architectural vulnerability.

### 7. PatchProxy Remote Code Modification

Every security-critical method contains a `ChangeQuickRedirect` field that allows the vendor to remotely modify method behavior via hot-patching — without app store review or user consent.

## Verification

All findings underwent **3-LLM cross-verification** (Claude Opus 4.6 + Sonnet 4.6 + Gemini 2.5 Pro):
- **21/23** claims verified TRUE against source code
- **2/23** SUSPECT (signing output byte count lacks preserved raw evidence)
- **0/23** FALSE
